## Web Terminal Features

The web terminal provides a full interactive shell experience:

- **Real-time Interaction**: Type commands and see output immediately
- **Full Shell Access**: Access to all bash features and commands
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Connection Management**: Connect/disconnect as needed
- **Terminal Controls**: Clear terminal, manage connections
- **Secure**: Each session is isolated and cleaned up properly

### Using the Web Terminal

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/terminal`
2. Click "Connect" to start a shell session
3. Type commands as you would in a regular terminal
4. Use "Disconnect" to end the session
5. Use "Clear" to clear the terminal output

## Allowed Commands

For security reasons, only the following commands are allowed in the REST API:

- `ls` - List directory contents
- `pwd` - Print working directory
- `whoami` - Print effective user ID
- `date` - Print or set system date and time
- `uptime` - Show system uptime
- `ps` - Report process status
- `df` - Report file system disk space usage
- `free` - Display amount of free and used memory
- `top` - Display system processes
- `cat` - Concatenate and print files
- `head` - Output the first part of files
- `tail` - Output the last part of files
- `grep` - Print lines matching a pattern
- `find` - Search for files in a directory hierarchy
- `echo` - Display a line of text
- `uname` - Print system information
- `hostname` - Print or set system hostname

**Note**: The web terminal provides full shell access and is not restricted to the above commands.

## Security Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Security Notes:**

1. **Command Whitelist**: Only predefined commands are allowed in the REST API to prevent arbitrary code execution
2. **Web Terminal**: Provides full shell access - use with extreme caution in production
3. **Timeout Protection**: Commands have a 30-second timeout to prevent hanging processes
4. **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated before execution
5. **Production Use**: This server is designed for development/testing. Use with caution in production environments
6. **Network Access**: Consider implementing authentication and HTTPS for production use
7. **Session Isolation**: Each web terminal session is isolated and cleaned up properly
